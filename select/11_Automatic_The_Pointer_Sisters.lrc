[00:34.89] Look what you're doing to me
[00:37.06] I'm utterly at your whim
[00:39.24] All of my defenses down
[00:43.39] Your camera looks through me
[00:46.19] With its X-ray vision
[00:47.83] And all systems run aground
[01:01.33] 
[00:51.80] All I can manage to push from my lips is a stream of absurdities
[01:00.36] Every word I intended to speak, winds up locked in a circuitry
[01:31.36] 
[01:09.49] No way to control it
[01:11.77] It's totally automatic
[01:14.09] Whenever you're around
[01:17.84] I'm walking blindfolded
[01:20.40] Completely automatic
[01:22.61] All of my systems are down
[01:25.99] Down, down, down
[01:27.11] Automatic (automatic)
[01:31.62] Automatic (automatic)
[01:42.12] 
[01:35.60] What is this madness
[01:37.83] That makes my motor run
[01:39.95] And my legs too weak to stand
[01:44.10] I go from sadness to exhilaration
[01:48.32] Like a robot at your command
[02:02.32] 
[01:52.62] My hands perspire and shake like a leaf
[01:56.55] Up and down goes my temperature
[02:01.22] I summon doctors to get some
[02:05.06] Relief, but t they tell me there is no cure
[02:09.30] They tell me
[02:15.30] 
[02:10.59] No way to control it
[02:12.66] It's totally automatic
[02:15.18] Whenever you're around

[02:42.94] 
[03:03.28] Automatic, automatic
[03:11.24] Automatic, automatic
