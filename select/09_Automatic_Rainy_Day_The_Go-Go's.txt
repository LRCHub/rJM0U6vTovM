You walk into the room and the temperature falls
The mood disappears
Chased away by the gathering storm
That is here

I look up painted sky full of memories
And this house has no roof to shelter me

It's an automatic rainy day
When I see you
It's the perfect consolation prize
A little piece of blue
It's an automatic rainy day

Just when it feels like the world
Is together and whole
You come around
Dragging your permanent cloud
And the weather turns cold

Hang around for a repeat of history
Falling down in the hole you dug for free

It's an automatic rainy day
When I see you
It's the perfect consolation prize
A little piece of blue
It's an automatic rainy day

When you see the reaction you cause
Does it make you sad?
Do you even realize
That you're such a drag?
